# PreciseFP_export
A program to export information from PreciseFP to Google Sheets

This is very much a WIP. The program is inefficient, but I just wanted to test how the API integrations worked and see what's possible.

I also wanted to test how it might work reading a PDF file.

The intention is to build something which allows the user to select the client, the appropriate fact find, the relevant mortgage illustration and then creates the advice document within seconds.

Please note; sensitive information such as the Bearer token has been hidden.

(So far the program is working as hoped)
